         3. Are the other inputs (if they exist) finalized, and of the correct type?
         4. Is the absolute fee >= fee of original tx?
         5. Check that the feerate of the transaction is not less than our minfeerate
            (after signing - we have the signed version here).
         6. If we have a change output, check that:
            - the change output still exists, exactly once
            - amount subtracted from self.change_out is less than or equal to
              maxadditionalfeecontribution.
            - Check that the MAFC is only going to fee: check difference between
              new fee and old fee is >= MAFC
            We do not need to further check against number of new inputs, since
            we already insisted on only paying for one.
         7. Does it contain no xpub information or derivation information?
         8. Are the sequence numbers unchanged (and all the same) for the inputs?
         9. Is the nLockTime and version unchanged?

    payment request data from the server, use its wallet_service to construct
    a payment transaction, with coins sourced from mixdepth `mixdepth`,

### What if I don't want to migrate to segwit yet?

If, for whatever reason, you want to keep using the non-segwit version of Joinmarket,
you can do so by adding the following entry in your `joinmarket.cfg` file:

```
[POLICY]
segwit = false
```

(obviously, add it *into* the `POLICY` section, don't create a duplicate of that
section. Also make sure to enter exactly `false` in lower case, otherwise it
will be ignored. The default is segwit).

If you do this, the pre-existing Joinmarket wallet should load fine and you should
be able to do coinjoins just as before.

Note, however, that most are migrating to segwit, and we strongly encourage it
(it's better not to have a split into two groups), not least because segwit
transactions are cheaper.

The rest of this document will assume you *do* want to migrate.

### Migrating to a new segwit based wallet.

To do joinmarket coinjoins with other participants using segwit, you need to use
a wallet with segwit addresses. These addresses are P2SH (start with '3' on mainnet);
note they are *not* multisig, however, they are yours only (technically we are using
address type P2SH/P2WPKH).

(Some parts of this are a repeat of what's in the [usage guide](USAGE.md)).

#### If you don't have an existing Joinmarket wallet:

You can go into the `scripts/` directory, which contains the `wallet-tool.py` script,
and follow the instructions as in the first half of:

https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket/wiki/Using-the-JoinMarket-internal-wallet

You will notice the main difference from what's shown there is that after using
the `generate` command, your new wallet has addresses starting with '3' not '1'.
Also, the BIP32 paths are different, see the bottom of this page for some details on that.

#### If you do have an existing Joinmarket wallet:

Migrating coins to this new-style wallet can be done in these steps:

* Install this new version (0.3.0+), use "Quickstart" from the [readme](../README.md) or see [here](INSTALL.md)

* Generate a new wallet; go into the `scripts/` directory and do the same as before:

    python wallet-tool.py generate

Once you've written down the 12 word seed and saved the new .json file, check the
addresses with:

    python wallet-tool.py newwallet.json

(or whatever you called the file). You should see a set of '3' addresses (or '2' on testnet) instead of '1'. Also the
spacing/layout may look a bit different, but it's the same information.

Note down at least 3 addresses from mixdepth 0 if you plan to use as a Taker; if as
a Maker (yieldgenerator), best to note down one address from each mixdepth.

Next, load your old wallet; you have two options - either (1) use your old Joinmarket
installation, or (2) use this one, and go into joinmarket.cfg and add:

    segwit = false

to the `[POLICY]` section. This will allow you to run `python wallet-tool.py` and it
will find the old wallet. Whether using method (1) or (2), the next step is the same:

Use `python sendpayment.py -N 0 -m [mixdepth] oldwalletname 0 destaddr` to send coins from
your old wallet, mixdepth 0, into the new one you've created, with a sweep from that
mixdepth. The -N 0 means using direct-send, i.e. not using joinmarket/IRC.
Don't forget to reset `tx_fees` in your joinmarket.cfg
if you want to adjust the projected fee.

If you've used (2), then delete the line `segwit = false` from joinmarket.cfg, and
reload the new wallet with `python wallet-tool.py newwalletname.json`

Once you're sure it's working you can repeat this process for any number of mixdepths
for which you want to transfer coins.

### Information about the new wallet type and compatibility.

First, the seed phrase is now based on BIP39, but this is transparent: it's still
a 12 word seed, but based on a new dictionary.
It uses the [mnemonic](https://github.com/trezor/python-mnemonic) package/implementation.

Second, this new wallet type is not compatible with the old; that doesn't make sense - even if it generated the same private keys,
you would still have to transfer to new segwit style outputs.

Third, the new type is based on [BIP49](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0049.mediawiki),
which is currently supported by TREZOR, Ledger, Electrum (via custom HD path option, only one account at a time), Samourai, Eclair to my knowledge, and probably others.
So these Joinmarket wallets could be loaded into those wallets, but be wary of privacy issues if querying your addresses over some external server.

BIP49 is a modification of BIP44 for segwit, but really it's just a new BIP32 HD path.
(To get even further into the technical weeds, these standards (44/49) use hardened derivation except for keys below the account level).


### Fees

Segwit doesn't have much direct technical import for Joinmarket, since coinjoin
(at least when properly implemented) isn't subject to any dangers from transaction
malleability.

However, there can be significant, if not huge, fee savings based on the change from 'size'
to 'weight' in block limits. Instead of paying (fee/kB) * kB of tx size, you pay
for (non-witness + 0.25 * witness)/4 * (fee/kB) (very rough explanation), which rough
calculations suggests might give ~ 25-30% savings over a non-segwit tx in a typical scenario.
Somewhat higher fee savings may be achieved if we switched to a "native" segwit address in future,
rather than a P2SH-wrapped one.

#### Note for Makers

Since segwit-style joinmarket must be done "all-in-one" for privacy (otherwise a Taker
risks creating a single '1' address output), the yieldgenerator in this implementation
makes `swreloffer` and `swabsoffer` offer types, and won't also offer original-type offers.
However, the parameters of the offer are the same, and are still set in the (now much
simplified) `yield-generator-basic.py` or `yg-privacyenhanced.py` scripts.

Other variants may be added later subject to anyone getting around to doing it.
